# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Challenge 16: 

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to use the Amazon AWS server to extract and review Toy data in PGAdmin. Through the use of external DB we are able to handle Big Data that otherwise be very troublesome on a home DB due to the size and voriaty of the Data. One of the goals was to manage data that follows the four V's: Voracity, Velocity, Varierty, and Volume which given the Toys data set that was analyzed in this challenge, checked all those boxxes.

## Results:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

*There were a total of 84 Vine Reviews for toys and 50562 non Vine Reviews

How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

*Of the 5 star reviews there were 36 while non-vine had 26267


What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

*The percentage came out to 0.42857 or 42% while nonvine reviews had a percentage of 0.51950 or 51%


##Summary: 

Having about 50% review rate via vine is actually really surprising. It's a shame that vine no longer exists, but it would be interesting to see this metric measured with TikTok reviews and youtube reviews as well. I feel the comparison would be pretty interesting and relevant to advertisers.
